MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) is a artificial neural network that has foundational architecture in deep learning and is used for various machine learning tasks, including classification(Perplexity AI, 2024).

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning model designed for processing data with a grid-like structure, such as images (Perplexity AI, 2024)
