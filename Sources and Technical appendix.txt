Important Vocabulary Dictionary
Pitch: Human perception of frequency that orders the frequency sound wave on a scale.

Frequency: Measurable rate of vibration.

Amplitude: Magnitude of a waveform.

Time: Measurable timeframe of an audio sample.

Sample: The audio file sample.

MLP: Multilayer perceptron is an artificial neural network that consists of many layers of neurons that can be used to learn complex patterns in data.

808: A percussive sound known for its low-frequency bass and distinct booming sound (named based on the classic Roland TR-808 drum machine).

Kick: A bass drum that is part of a drum kit and that is typically played by stepping on a pedal attached to a mallet.
